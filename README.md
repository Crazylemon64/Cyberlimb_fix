# Cyberlimb Fix

Piggybacks off of [UDAA][UDAA]'s rendering fix ASM patches to make [Cyberware][Cyberware]'s
limb rendering code display at the right position

## Compile
To compile, create a folder called `libs` and insert a jar of [UDAA][UDAA] for version 1.10.2 in there. Then, run `gradlew build` and things should proceed as normal - the final jar should be in `build/libs`.

## Credits
Credits to MysteryEm for [UDAA][UDAA] and the patch system.
